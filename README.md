Madison 2015 Wordpress Theme
===

This is a Wordpress theme developed jointly by CALS and the Library and is meant to serve as a template freely available to anyone on campus. It shares a similar design language to that of the new wisc.edu and can be easily adjusted within the theme options to have several 'variants' that allow various implementations to better showcase differing online identities.
